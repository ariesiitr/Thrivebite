      <p><i>People face problems in finding calories and some other information associated to the food they are consuming as they have limited access to nutrition information.</p><p> Many people may not have access to accurate and reliable information about the calorie content of the food they eat. This can make it difficult for them to make informed choices about their nutrition.
    </p><p>And as a diary shows their progress, people are not able to track their calorie intake , based on which they could track if they should consume more or less according to their body mass index and the exercise they do daily.</p><p> Diet can be given by dieticians but tracking the daily calorie intake based on every single item they are taking is hectic in this busy world.
         </p><p>The online resources which aid the formation of personalized diet plans for its users, are framed to be only useful for foreign markets and not for India, as the meals in the daily routine barely contain ingredients that the regional market is familiar with.

      <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">--Our Solution--</span></h5>

      <p><i>So here we come up with a solution by making a website which provides a simple UI so that the users can add their timely calorie intake.</p><p>
        It gives the nutritional data of the item we are eating. </p><p>Apart from this, it gives the user the total calories a person has taken in a day. After a day a person can also reset it. </p><p>
        The key focus of thought for our website is that we can compare our intake and the calories needed based on whether the person wants to increase or decrease weight.</p>
<p>        We calculate how many calories a person should take to increase or decrease weight based on his Body Mass Index.</p><p> Gender and age are major factors which cannot be neglected for the intake of calories of a person so we have also considered that.</p><p>
        We have also taken his exercise routine in consideration as exercising plays a major role in weight maintain and nutrition. </p>

<p>Finding resources and data wasnâ€™t an easy task to do.</p><p>We faced a problem in integrating the Dataset in our project.</p><p>We were unable to integrate the values fetched to DBMS which we were planning to do so that we can show a graph of some previous days and maintain a month record, but due to Lack of time we could not link .</p>
